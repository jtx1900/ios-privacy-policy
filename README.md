#Privacy Policy

Last Updated: [2025-05-07]

[ledsync] ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in our iOS app.

1. No Data Collection
Our ArtNet lighting control app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data, including:

No names, emails, or Apple IDs.

No usage analytics or tracking.

No device identifiers (e.g., IP address, UDID).

No location or camera/microphone access.

2. Network & ArtNet Protocol
The app communicates via ArtNet (DMX over IP) to control lighting systems. This requires local network access but does not transmit data outside your network.

3. No Third-Party Sharing
Since we collect no user data, we do not share anything with third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.

4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
Our app does not target or collect data from children under 13 (or 16 in the EU).
